      <p class='px-4 md:px-24 lg:px-32 text-xs text-center'><span class='font-semibold'>Loans Rate and Terms Disclosure</span>: Rates for loans provided by lenders directly on the SuperDinero platform range between 3.84-35.99% APR with terms from 24 to 84 months. Rates presented include lender discounted rates for joining in autopay and loyalty programs, where applicable. Actual rates may be different from the rates advertised and/or shown and will be based on the lender’s eligibility criteria, which include factors such as credit score, loan amount, loan term, credit usage and history, and vary based on loan purpose. The lowest rates available typically require excellent credit, and for some lenders, may be reserved for specific loan purposes and/or shorter loan terms. The origination fee charged by the lenders on our platform varies so please check the terms of your offer. Each lender has their own qualification criteria with respect to their autopay and loyalty discounts (e.g., some lenders require the borrower to elect autopay prior to loan funding in order to qualify for the autopay discount). All rates are determined by the lender and must be agreed upon between the borrower and the borrower’s chosen lender. SuperDinero is not a bank nor a lender, does not broker loans to lenders and does not make credit or loan decisions. This web page does not constitute an offer nor a solicitation to lend. For full details on any service or product you must see the terms on the financial institution’s website that is making you an offer. If you have further customer service questions, please feel free to call (888) 839-7029. An example of total amount paid on a personal loan of $20,000 for a term of 60 months at a rate of 15% would be equivalent to $28,547.92 over the 60 month life of the loan.
